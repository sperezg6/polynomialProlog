# polynomialProlog
Prolog program that solves, adds, mulltiplies, and evaluates polynomials functions.
A polynomial function is given in form of a list. For example, [2,4,1] represents  2+4*x+x^2.

Methods:
  1) Degree.  Determines de degree of the polynomial. [1,3,4] is a polynoimial fucntion of degree 2.
  2) Addition. Adds two different polynomial functions, returns the sum in a different list. 
  3) Substrantion. Substact two differnt functions returning the result in a diffent list. Can return a negative number.
  4) Product of a fucntion times a scalar number. Multiplies de functions times a given number. The result is given on a new list.
  5) Product of two polynomial functions.
  6) Evaluation. Evaluates a function on a given number. Returns a single number.
  7) Differentiate. Derivates de given function,.
  8) toString. Transforms the format of the list and prints the polynomial function.
